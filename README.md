* Engaging UI with a local theme.
* Light and dark theme toggle.

* **Internationalization:** i18n
* **Data:** Local TypeScript files for POIs, quizzes, and badges.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js **20.x** (set as `NODE_VERSION`)
* pnpm package manager

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Mikieb1982/GeoQuiz.git](https://github.com/Mikieb1982/GeoQuiz.git)
    cd GeoQuiz
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    Using `npm` may fail because of peer dependency conflicts.

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

4.  **Build the Cloudflare worker:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run build:worker
    ```
    This command generates the worker output in the `.open-next` folder.

5.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    ```bash
    wrangler deploy
    ```
    Deployment requires Cloudflare credentials (`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).
    The worker expects the `DB` and `ASSETS` bindings defined in `wrangler.toml`.

### Static Export for GitHub Pages

GeoQuiz can be published as a static site using GitHub Pages:

1. Run the export script:
   ```bash
   pnpm run export:ghpages
   ```
   The static site will be generated in the `docs/` directory.
2. Commit the `docs/` folder and push it, for example to a `gh-pages` branch.
3. In your repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the
   appropriate source (the `docs/` folder or the `gh-pages` branch).

### Deployment on Netlify

To deploy on Netlify with the `/GeoQuiz` base path, build the site and then move
the static output into a subdirectory. Set the publish directory to `out`:

```bash
pnpm run build && node ./scripts/move-export-to-subdir.js
```

The included `netlify.toml` enables the official Netlify Next.js plugin and
uses this configuration automatically.
