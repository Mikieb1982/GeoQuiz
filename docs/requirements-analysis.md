# Project Requirements and Technical Approach

This document summarizes the initial planning steps for the Bad Belzig Abenteuer Geo Quiz project.

## App Requirements and Constraints
- Must run on common mobile and desktop browsers without installing native apps.
- Needs offline capability for visitors without stable internet access.
- Supports English and German languages.
- Uses only free and open-source libraries.

## Technical Approach
- Built as a **web application** using **Next.js** and **React** with TypeScript.
- Mapping handled with **Leaflet** and **react-leaflet** using OpenStreetMap tiles.
- PWA-style caching ensures offline map availability.
- Data is stored locally in the browser; no backend is required.

## Development Tools
- Source control with **GitHub**.
- Dependency management with **pnpm**.
- Testing performed with **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
- Linting via the default Next.js ESLint config and **TypeScript** for type safety.

## Project Timeline (high level)
1. Setup repository and choose technologies.
2. Implement map and geolocation basics.
3. Add quiz, badge, and i18n features.
4. Polish UI/UX and ensure offline functionality.
5. Final testing and documentation.
